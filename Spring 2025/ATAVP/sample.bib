  abstract = {Stakeholders envision the introduction of electric and hybrid-electric aircraft into operation by 2035. First developments of such aircraft have demonstrated that the existing technologies do not allow realization of hybrid-electric aircraft matching the performance of traditional aircraft with the same load factors. The major challenge of future hybrid-electric aircraft development is the considerable improvement of the energetic efficiencies. This paper evaluates the (i) problems and barriers (ii) emerging and required future technologies of effective hybrid-electric propulsion systems and (iii) adaptation of the aircraft conceptual design process for the development of hybrid-electric aircraft. The developed methodology is applied to the conceptual design of a small aircraft with hybrid-electric propulsion system. The results demonstrate that the adapted conceptual design methods with (i) constrains on mass fraction adapted to new technologies and solutions, (ii) constraints defined for energy fractions for flight mission legs, (iii) considering radically new elements and technologies in aircraft design and (iv) developing unconventional aircraft, aircraft operations may allow the development of small hybrid-electric aircraft with acceptable performance.},

  abstract = {Aircraft design has become increasingly complex since it depends on technological advances and integration between modern engineering systems. These systems are multidisciplinary, i.e., any process or division of any aircraft design produces effects in all others, making the definition of each parameter a significant challenge. In this context, this work presents a general multidisciplinary design optimization method for the conceptual design of general aviation and hybrid-electric aircraft. The framework uses efficient computational methods comprising modules of engineering that include aerodynamics, flight mechanics, structures, and performance, and the integration of all of them. The aerodynamic package relies on a Nonlinear Vortex Lattice Method solver, while the flight mechanics package is based on an analytical procedure with minimal dependence on historical data. Moreover, the structural module adopts an analytical sizing approach using boom idealization, and the performance of the aircraft is computed based on energy and power required to accomplish a specific mission. The objective functions are to minimize the fuel consumption and to minimize the takeoff weight. The Pareto-optimal front encompasses aircraft with different propulsive architectures: turboelectric, hybrid electric, and fully electric. The degrees of hybridization defined by the optimization and the mission requirements chosen in this study directly affect the final weight breakdown of the aircraft, which is related to the sizing of the wings, propulsive system, and horizontal and vertical tails.},
