\section*{Problem 1}
Consider a 2 DOF system with two rigid blocks that can move only in the horizontal direction, as shown in
the following figure.

\subsection*{Part 1}
Give the expressions for the strain (potential) energy ($\Pi$), work done by external forces ($W_f$), and the
total potential energy ($\Pi_t=\Pi-W_f$).

\subsection*{Part 2}
Drive the equilibrium equations for the system using the minimum potential energy principle.

\section*{Problem 2}
Consider again the simplest problem of a continuum 1D bar of uniform cross-section studied in Q1-HW1.
The bar is fixed at the left-end and is of length $l$ and section area $A$. It is subjected to a uniform body
force $f_x$ and a concentrated force $F_s$ at the right end. The youngâ€™s modulus of the material is $E$. Using
the method of minimum potential energy, obtain the distribution of the displacement for the following cases.

\subsection*{Part 1}
$f_x=0$ and $F_s=$ constant

\subsection*{Part 2}
$f_x=$ constant and $F_s=$ constant
