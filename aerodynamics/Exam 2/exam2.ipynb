    "We can see that as camber increases, CL increases. This makes sense as cambering an airfoil makes it generate the same lift at a lower angle of attack, so increasing camber at the same angle of attack would show airfoils generating more lift. CD also increases with increasing camber. This could be similar to the increase of thickness because of increased wetted area or frontal area, but also cambered airfoils tend to have odd pressure interactions and vortices that would also increase the drag and increasing camber exacerbates this effect. Finally, CM increases with increased camber (opposite to thickness). This makes sense as when increasing thickness, the airfoils are increasing their moment of intertia. However, for increasing camber the moment of inertia should stay relatively similar. Also, an increase in camber leads to a larger increase in lift than an increase in thickness does (both with a relatively small increase in CD), so not increasing the moment of intertia means CM must increase as well."
